Hi! I'm Jonathan Mares. I'm currently based out of the East Bay in Northern California and am an engineering manager at [Quorum](https://www.quorum.us/).
Originally from Be'er Sheva, Israel, I grew up in New York and spent my college years at Cornell, studying Chemical Engineering and Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing classical and jazz piano, soccer, mountain biking, motorcycles, and pretending to understand wine.
